// What are DOM event listeners. AddEventListener, RemoveEventListener. Why do we need removal?

// answer:

// Everything that happens or acting in a program, known as events and the system inform
// you about that action by it's event and we can handle it.

// we need removal because sometimes it's need to remove previously added event handler, or maybe
// its need to remove useless listeners to free memory and get rid of the lacks.
